Hi! I am Lin Shi (you can call me Slim) from Beijing, China. I am currently a rising senior undergraduate at Dartmouth College (2022–2025), double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interests center on applying AI and technology to address real-world challenges - what I refer to as **AI for X**. Over the years, I’ve explored various **X** domains, including sports, transportation/urban planning, quantitative finance, software engineering, healthcare, and, most recently, **education**. Regarding AI, I am mostly interested in NLP and LLMs, with prior work on LLM evaluations and mechanistic interpretability. As the "first generation undergrad of ChatGPT" whose entire college life is accompanied by advancing generative AI, I am honored to witness its revolutionary impact on all aspects and excited to contribute to its advancement, promotion, and applications.

## Academics & Research
I have pursued diverse research experiences across institutions. My journey began in high school, conducting transportation research at Harvard with [Faan Chen](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cfa/bio). At the Shanghai AI Lab, I began research on AI for Software Engineering (AI4SWE). At Dartmouth, I’m engaged in NLP and LLM research with Professor [Soroush Vosoughi](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/soroush-vosoughi). However, teaching has been a deeply rewarding aspect of my lifeand and has inspired my interest in **AI Education**. Right now, I am collaborating with Dartmouth faculties to develop adaptive learning agents that personalize student's learning experience in introductory CS courses. This AI Education initiative at Dartmouth will serve as my senior thesis. 

I am looking forward to discussions and potential collaborations! If you are interested, please reach out to me by [lin.shi.26@dartmouth.edu]()

## Personal Interests

I strongly value work-life balance and believe interdisciplinary exploration — both academic and non-academic — drives innovation. Sports play a significant role in my life:

- **Alpine Skiing**: I am a China's alpine ski athlete who won the Beijing U18 Championships and qualified for the national training team.
- **Badminton**: At Dartmouth, I compete as part of the Competitive Badminton Team.
- **Swimming**: I used to swim competitively, but I retired due to a shoulder injury sustained while skiing.
- **Fishing**: I am a crazy fan of fishing, enjoying 传统钓，台钓, lure fishing, fly fishing, and sea fishing.
- Basketball, billiards/pool, and ping pong are also among my interests, though less competitively.

I’m always eager to try new sports - I believe in my adaptability and talent!

Beyong sports, I also love breeding parrots (especially rainbow budgerigar), solving Rubik's Cubes, and cooking. These hobbies have sustained me during tough academic and research endeavors......

If you’d like to take my ski lesson (any level - I've been teaching beginners for seasons) or explore any of the interests above, don’t hesitate to reach out at [slimshilin2004@gmail.com]()!
