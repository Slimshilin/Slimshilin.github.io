Hi! I am Lin Shi (you can call me Slim) from Beijing, China. I am currently a rising seninor undergrad at Dartmouth College (2022-2025), double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. My research interest lies in applying AI and technologies to a wide range of fields to solve real-life problems, or **AI for X**. I have explored various **X** in the past: sports, transportation/urban planning, quant finance, software engineering, healthcare, and most recently, education. Regarding AI, I am mostly interested in NLP and LLMs, with previous explorations on LLM evaluations and mechanistic interpretability. As the "first generation undergrad of ChatGPT" whose entire college life is accompanied by advancing generative AI, I am honored to witness its revolutionary impact on all aspects and excited to contribute to its advancement, promotion, and applications.


## Academics & Research
I have been doing transportation research at Harvard with [Dr. Faan Chen](https://scholar.harvard.edu/cfa/bio) since high school, AI4SWE research at Shanghai AI Lab, and NLP/LLM research with [Professor Soroush Vosoughi](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/people/soroush-vosoughi) at Dartmouth. However, teaching has been a deeply rewarding aspect of my lifeand and has inspired my interest in **AI Education**. Right now, I am collaborating with Dartmouth faculties to develop adaptive learning agents that personalize student's learning experience in introductory CS courses. This AI Education initiative at Dartmouth that will serve as my senior thesis. 

I am looking forward to discussions and potential collaborations! If you are interested, please reach out to me by [lin.shi.26@dartmouth.edu]()

## Personal Interests
I strongly value work-life balance and believe interdisciplinary exploration—both academic and non-academic—drives innovation. Sports play a significant role in my life:

- **Alpine Skiing**: I am a China's alpine ski athlete who won the Beijing U18 Championships and qualified for the national training team.
- **Badminton**: At Dartmouth, I compete as part of the Competitive Badminton Team.
- **Swimming**: I used to swim competitively, but I retired due to a shoulder injury sustained while skiing.
- **Fishing**: I am a crazy fan of fishing, enjoying 传统钓，台钓, lure fishing, fly fishing, and sea fishing.
- Basketball, billiards/pool, and ping pong are also among my interests, though less competitively.
I’m always eager to try new sports - I believe in my adaptability and talent!

Beyong sports, I also love breeding parrots (especially rainbow budgerigar), solving Rubik's Cubes, and cooking. These hobbies have sustained me during challenging academic and research endeavors......

If you’d like to join me for a ski lesson (any level - I’ve taught beginners for multiple seasons) or explore any of the interests above, don’t hesitate to reach out at [slimshilin2004@gmail.com]()!
