## About

Hi! I am Lin Shi from Beijing, China. I am currently a Master student in Computer Science at Cornell Tech (2025–2026). I graduated with High Honors from Dartmouth College early (2022–2025), where I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics and was recognized as a Presidential Scholar, Neukom Scholar, and URAD Scholar.

I have been leading and/or participating in 10+ research projects with Stanford University, CMU, Harvard, Cornell, Dartmouth, Microsoft Research Asia, Shanghai AI Lab, Zhipu AI, etc. I am honored to work with [Professor Ludwig Schmidt](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ludwigs/) (Stanford) on [Terminal Bench](https://github.com/laude-institute/terminal-bench) (**Stanford x Laude Institute**), [Professor Soroush Vosoughi](https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/soroush-vosoughi) (Dartmouth) on LLM evaluation, [Professor Paulo Carvalho](https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/paulo-carvalho) (CMU) on AI Education, and [Professor Faan Chen](https://chinaproject.harvard.edu/people/faan-chen) (Harvard) on transportation and environment research.

Recently, I study how AI can become stronger programmers, focusing on their ability to write, debug, and reason about code that achieves complex tasks and aligns with human preferences. I approach the problem through the lens of **dataset benchmark**, **evaluation methodology**, and **architectural advancement**. I am also interested in how AI-augmented programming reshapes human learning and developer workflows, i.e., *what we should* and *how we could* teach and learn about coding in this special age of AI.

As a former alpine ski athlete and currently an AI researcher, I believe in my brain power more than my physical body; but the lessons and spirit from competitive sports and diverse hobbies largely shape who I am now. I am always open to exploring new fields of research, just as I always welcome unlocking new sports/playful activities.

Feel free to reach out to me about academics, research, shared hobbies, or anything you want!
